# In week one of the course, we covered _Markdown_. 

### _Markdown_ is a powerful ability inside of GitHub that allows you to edit and change how your text appears inside of GitHub.

Below are a couple of Markdown cheatsheets that are helpful to reference when creating `.md` files:

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/Cheatsheet-lang/Git-markdown) - This is the quickest link to view many capabilities of Markdown.
- [Learn Markdown](https://learnmarkdown.com/) - This is another helpful cheatsheet for understanding Markdown.

Below is a tutorial showcasing Markdown

### Note:
I created this page inside of `References` because I feel that this information will be helpful to access quickly, so as opposed to viewing it in the Week 1 lessons,
I made a page here.
